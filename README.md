## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
In the Waterfall methodology, one follows a specific structure of steps ie: Analysis, plannind, design. While in Agile, there is no specific structure that needs to be followed for the project to be completed.
Adv of Waterfall: Clear and defined process.
                  Easier to manage for small projects.
                  Better for predictability.
                  Stable requirements.
Dis of Waterfall: Inflexible to changes.
                  Late testing.
                  Limited customer feedback.
                  High risk of failure.
Adv of Agile: Flexibility and adaptability.
              Faster delivery.
              Continuous feedback.
              Increased transparency.
Dis of Agile: Can be hard to scale.
              Unclear end goal.
              More time spent on communication.
              Documentatiopn may be lacking.
              
                

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is more beneficial than Waterfall when it comes to larger projects like a hospital system, projects where quick delivery is important like E-commerce website launch.
Waterfall is more beneficial than Agile for smaller projects like a simple application, projects with fixed budget like government projects.
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Requirement analysis and planning- By understanding the business needs, the development team can ensure that the software meets those needs, and needs minimal to no revisions.
Automated Testing- Automating repeptitive taks ie: unit testing, gives the developers more time to focus on the more complex testing tasks.
Manual Testing- While automated tasks are essential, some tasks require human judgement for better reults.
Code reviews- Regular code reviews ensures the code is clean and free of bugs.
Continuous monitoring- Continuous monitoring helps detect user experience issues, and bugs that may have not been detected during testing.

Maintaining high standards is important because: It ensures product quality and reliability.
                                                Reduces costs in the long run.
                                                Enhances user experience.
                                                Supports regulaotry compliance.
                                                

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining the project conrtibutes to successful project planning becuase it establishes a clear framework for the projects' objectives deliverables, taska, timelines, and resources.
A WBS is hierachal decomposition of the project into smaller, more manageable componenets or tasks. 
It is useful because: It provides a clear picture of the project scope.
                      It allows for better planning of resources by identifying which tasks need to be completed, and by whom.
                      By breaking the project into smaller tasks, it makes it easier to assign specific respnsibilities to team members.
                      It improves scheduling and time management, as each task can be associated with a timeline, enabling more accurate scheduling.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Some benefits include: Clear timeline and deadlines.
                       Resource allocation and optimization.
                       Aloows for tracking and monitoring progress.
                       Budget control.
                       Improved coordination and collaboration.
Gantt charts can assist in this process through: Visual representation of the Project Timeline.
                                                Milestone tracking.
                                                Monitoring progress.
                                                Flexibility and adjustments.
